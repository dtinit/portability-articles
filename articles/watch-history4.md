# Netflix Viewing History 

Netflix offers an interface to download your personal data via their website. Within the Account Settings Overview page, the Edit Settings option provides first a "Viewing Activity" subpage with a list of episodes viewed, without further information. Separately, under Security within Account Settings, the "Personal Info Access" option provides an interface to request a download of viewing data. No further customizations or options are provided. The user is informed that this process may take up to 30 days.

For users who are not owners of an account but whose email address is associated with a profile in the account, Netflix's [reference page](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100624) suggests the user can email privacy at netflix dot com to request a copy of their personal activity data.
