# Apple iCloud photos to Google Photos

Apple offers a way to request a transfer of photos and videos stored in iCloud Photos to Google Photos
that happens in the cloud, without requiring you to have enough bandwidth and disk storage to do the
transfer via export and then separate upload.  The [excellent support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208514) 
explains how to go to [privacy.apple.com](https://privacy.apple.com/) to transfer directly to Google Photos.

The interoperability basis for this transfer is the use of [Data Transfer Project](https://github.com/google/data-transfer-project) servers.
The DTP platform is an extensible Open Source platform for server-to-server data transfers specifically for user data as requested by users.
