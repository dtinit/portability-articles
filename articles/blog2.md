* Joomla - [WPBeginner Guide](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/ultimate-wordpress-migration-guide/)
* Medium - see both WPBeginner and [WordPress guide](https://wordpress.com/support/import/import-from-medium/)
* Shopify - [WPBeginner Guide](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/ultimate-wordpress-migration-guide/)
* Squarespace - [WordPress guide](https://wordpress.com/support/import/import-from-squarespace/)

Some of these are more turnkey than others.  WPBeginner offers free migration services under some conditions, others 
have instructions on how to export data from the source system and reimport to a WordPress site.


## What these solutions will do

Many of the transfer options involve exporting content from one platform, and importing it to WordPress, including the
Blogger, Medium and Squarespace steps.  The user will need a computer on which to download the content from one site and
upload to another. 

## What these solutions will not do

Transfering additional information to WordPress beyond content pages may involve much more work or not be possible

* Moving from an e-commerce service like Shopify or Gumroad can move
content and listings, but because a WordPress user must figure out their own e-commerce plugin for sales, moving 
customer data and past sales data will be much harder.

* Content may be copied from Tumblr, but the social graph would not be.
