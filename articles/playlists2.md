# Use Soundiiz online service to synchronize playlists between music services

## SongShift

The [Soundiiz service](https://soundiiz.com/features) offers a number of features for moving
playlists between different music streaming services.  One of the challenges in this domain
is matching song titles, artists and track information so that the song you listen to on one 
platform is actually the same song linked when the playlist is created on another platform.  There's
no common identifier for music tracks or albums (like ISBN for books) so the problem of matching
is why it's hard for you to simply export your playlists on one service and load them into a 
different service - not only the playlist export format but also the track identifiers are likely
to be non-interoperable.

## What this solution can do

Playlists can be copied one-time to another service, and Soundiiz also supports [synchronizing](
https://soundiiz.com/auto-sync-playlist). There are other features around sharing that might
be useful too.


## What this solution does not do

Some ways this might not work for you:
* It does require integrating a 3rd service
* Some features (such as automating the transfer of multiple playlists rather than selecting
and transfering them one by one) require a small monthly subscription fee
