# Amazon Photos

Amazon's [photo storage service](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Photos) boasts unlimited photo storage for Prime members.
Over time this can of course result in more photos in the cloud than a user can easily transfer to another 
service.  


The only option today for moving photos from Amazon to a different service is to begin by downloading, and hope that
uploading to another service goes well.  Some users may have challenges with storage or bandwidth.  Photos can easily
be 2MB each, requiring a GB of storage for each 500 photos.  It's worth using specific bulk export tools rather than 
using the regular Web page interface for photos, because bulk export tools have been desgined to require less
back-and-forth and complete more reliably. 

Amazon support [recommends using Amazon Drive](
https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00008Lj1oaSAB/how-to-download-all-prime-photos-to-external-hard-drive)
as the interface through which to download photos.  A [3rd party article suggests using the Photos interface](
https://robots.net/tech/how-to-transfer-photos-from-amazon-photos-to-external-hard-drive/) directly.  In either
case, it does not seem possible to do a single bulk download/export of photos, and instead the user must
select multiple files and photos and hope to select and download them all eventually using some methodical process.

## Further information

This article would be improved with some more information about what the export looks like and whether metadata
is completely lost.  [Contributions welcome](https://github.com/dtinit/portability-articles)!
