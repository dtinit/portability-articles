# portability-articles
A public-domain collection of articles to help find solutions for data portability, hosted at the [Portability Map site](portmap.dtinit.org) and administered by the [Data Transfer Initiative](dtinit.org). This project is made to support data rights and data portability by sharing user educational material on how to exercise those rights and transfer personal data.

To use the collection of articles to move or access your data online, please go ahead to the hosted [Portability Map](portmap.dtinit.org) and make selections to discover what articles and solutions may help you control and move your own data in the cloud.

To contribute, update an existing article in this GitHub repository or create a new one! We can also use Issues to track requests, 
suggestions and errors.

To create a new article:
 * Copy all the markdown in the [template file](template.md)
 * Create a new article in the articles directory
 * The article should have a permanent name that can serve as a file name - articles on porting videos can be called
   "videos1.md" "videos2.md" and so on, so if the next available name is "videos3.md" use that.
 * Paste the text from the template file in
 * Use a [supported data type](datatype-help.yaml) or add a new one (see below)
 
To add a new datatype:
 * Confirm it's listed in the [Content Plan file](content-plan.md)
 * Add an entry to [datatype-help.yaml](datatype-help.yaml) for the new data type
 * (Recommended) Choose a matching icon from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and add it to the [Portability Map](https://github.com/dtinit/portmap), or just [create an issue](https://github.com/dtinit/portmap/issues/new?title=Add%20an%20icon%20for%20new%20datatype%20%5BDATATYPE%20NAME%20HERE%5D) for it.

You will need to [fork the repository, clone it](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and submit a pull request when your change or addition is ready.

After a pull request is merged, the article will shortly appear on the [site](portmap.dtinit.org) but will remain available in this repository as a resource in the public commons.
