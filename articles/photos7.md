# Google Photos to Apple iCloud photos

Google offers a way to request a transfer of photos and videos stored in Google Photos to iCloud Photos that happens in the cloud, without requiring you to have enough bandwidth and disk storage to do the transfer via export and then separate upload. Support articles on this process are offered by both [Apple](https://support.apple.com/HT213483) and [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9666875).

## What this solution can do

Photos and videos are imported along with metadata including file name, description, file type, and location are also transferred.

## What this solution does not do

 * It does not transfer: Live photos, motion photos, memories.
 * Files not supported in iCloud Photos, such as RAW files, are transferred instead to iCloud Drive.
