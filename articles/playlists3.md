# Transfer playlists between YouTube Music playlists and Apple Music.

## Youtube Music to Apple Music

The process for transfering from YouTube Music is described in both [Google Takeout documentation](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/14792019),
where the transfer begins, and an [Apple Support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/107776).  If your playlists
are already in YouTube Music, Google is the exporter.  It sends the playlists to an account you choose and 
authorize on Apple.

When the transfer is done, you will receive an email with your Apple ID associated email.  


## Apple Music to YouTube Music

Plalists already on Apple Music can be copied to YouTube Music using some of the same underlying technology and with 
some of the same caveats.  Starting from Apple Music playlists, as described in the [Apple Support Article](
https://support.apple.com/en-us/120030), Apple's Data and Privacy page offers data transfer functionality.  You'll need to already have a YouTube Music account.

## What this solution can do

The playlist transfer technology does song metadata matching to attempt to accurately identify a song on one system with the best 
match on another service. Since most commercial songs are already available on both services, it's not actually
transfering the audio files.  Audio files are not transferred, therefore any imported or uploaded audio files (including podcasts, 
audio books or your own audio uploads) are not transferred.

## What this solution does not do

* This approach does not copy *podcasts* or *audio books*.
* Uploaded audio files are not copied.  
* Playlists from other users, saved to your library, are not transferred.
