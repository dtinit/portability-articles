# Approach

Squarespace offers an article explaining how to 
[move a WordPress site to SquareSpace](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008374348-Moving-from-WordPress-to-Squarespace).

## What this approach can do 

This can move content and domain.  Content includes attachments, blog pages, authors, categories, comments, and MOST images.

## What this approach can't do

The instructions from SquareSpace explain that a site's layout, design and fonts cannot move.  It may be easier to start
from a new template and focus on moving content into it.

Also be sure to read the instructions on what kinds of images don't get imported. 

SquareSpace has a different ecosystem of plugins from WordPress, so any plugins that the WordPress site relied upon will need to be considered
separately.
